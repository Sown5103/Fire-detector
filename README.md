# Fire-detector
This project aims to create a smart fire monitoring system using the Blynk IoT platform. 
By integrating fire and gas sensors with NodeMCU ESP8266, the system detects fire 
hazards and promptly alerts users through the Blynk mobile app. With telephone control, 
configuration options, and detailed status display, users can efficiently manage and 
respond to alerts.
